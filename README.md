This doesn't matter yet, the file has to have the app.
Instructions: 
Download the flipper zero app then open the app and connect it to your flipper zero device, update it to 0.75.0 if you haven't, backup your flipper zero just in case, go to options and then go to file manager, then go to /any/music_player (press /any then press /music_player), press the plus symbol at the top right corner and press file and past the music file in there.
